			<h3>Passion Project</h3>

			<p><strong>Project Description: </strong> My passion project would be to design DJ software that incorporates
				all elements that I love from every software out to date. I would love to be able to design the layout of
				the program to be inviting to the user and be graphically inclined. To have a truly strong program would
				entail a lot of engineering so that the music would be able to play back properly while being manipulated
				by any on board effects or and pitch bending. To keep a balance of these things is crucial in order to have
				a program that can be used at home or at huge festivals.</p>

			<p><strong>Elevator Pitch:</strong> Hi, my Name is Adrian Tsosie. I am a Jr. Coder and Graphic Designer that
				runs my own graphic driven tech company. I have spendt time learing	many different coding and programing skills.
				This in turn helped me to evolve my understanding of the “In the now tech” to build websites, apps and programs
				for the tech savvy person. Will you be ready for what is next in the world of technology?</p>

		<h3>Weekly Activities</h3>
			<h4>Week 1 Summary</h4>
			<p>The first week in the bootcamp was exciting and a little overwhelming at first. But once I got use to how
				the work flows went each day I got use to it. This week we touched base on HTML, Javascript, CSS and ended
				the week learning MySQL and Databases. Anther thing we got started on was our Pro Dev sites that outlined
				some personal information about ourselves. With help from my fellow team members bd the support from all the
				staff, I believe cohort 23 will be a success. On Friday we went over to Fatpipe and sat in on a tech metting
			 	that talked about TechHire New Mexico and everything they offer for students and employers. I got some good
				info that I'm going to pass on to my cousin.</p>

			<h4>Week 2 Summary</h4>
				<p>The 2nd week of bootcamp got more intense. This week we jumed into object oriented. Thanks to the help of
					my class mates I'm starting to get it more. We learend about. Autolaod.php., composer.jsn, validateDate.php.
					and validateUuid.php. This week we also got to go check out an App compititon at UNM. It was nice to ee what
					our capstone projcts can do if we workd hard on them. Looking forowrd to what is in store for us. </p>

			<h4>Week 3 Summary</h4>
				<p>This week was like walking into a hurrican. I was hung up on OO2 until Friday but finally figured at ut. Our
					capstone project came to together nicley. I was able to get a new resume added to my ProDev page. On Friday
					we have some guess speakers come in and talk to use about how the internet works from a technical tans point.
					I got mee someone elese who does projection maping and ask her a few questions. By the end of th week i felt
					good about how the week progressed. Now to see what week 4 has in store for us.
